# Collectorsgramm

This project is the culmination of my learning journey at Flatiron school .This is a full-stack web application built using React, Python, and Flask-SQLAlchemy. Inspired by my love for music and vinyl records, the goal of this project was to create a social media site for vinyl collectors, where users can create accounts, log in, and connect with other vinyl enthusiasts like myself.

## Features

* User Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to the site.
* Main Feed: Users can access a main feed page where they can view posts from users they are following.
* Follow/Unfollow Functionality: Users can follow or unfollow other users.
* Vinyl Record Posts: Each post in the feed represents a vinyl record owned by the user. Users can click on a post to view detailed information about the record.
* Likes and Comments: Users can like and comment on posts.
* User Profiles: Users can visit other users' profiles and access their own profile page through a navbar link.
* Profile Customization: Users can customize their profile settings on a dedicated settings page.
* User Discovery: Users can discover and follow other users through a discovery page.
